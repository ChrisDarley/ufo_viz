                               UFO VIZ to do list:



# things I still need to change:
# 1) put each major div into its own color background box
# 2) make the choropleth graph

# ideas for graph



# Ideas for cloropleth graph:

# IMPORTANT - consider normalizaion by area or by population (if available)
# year slider and have it be selectable by shape
# chloropleth map down to counties, num by year
# small lines seperating counties
# large lines seperating states ideally

# maybe also a scatter
# searchable by shape
# overlay of areaa 51, skinwalker ranch, etc



# To do list for graph data:

# 1) Drop counties that are not in the counties geojson file from the main
#    dataset and from the population dataset

# 2) Figure out a strategy for normalizing data for counties with decades that 
     have no population data but do have ufo sightings
	Possible solutions:
	a) moving forward or back to the closest population
	b) imputing population based on percentage increases and decreases
	   within the same state

# 3) Add zero values to all counties that do not have any sightings ever

# 4) A couple configuration options for this graph:
	a) cumulative time series by decade, linear scale
	b) non cumulative time series by year or decade, linear scale
	c) both maps on the same page
	d) One map only, but with an option to select cumulative or not
